Observables are like a subscription to a data stream. 
Asynchronous Operations: Observables are well-suited for handling asynchronous tasks like API calls, timers, and user events.

This means that the Observable will eventually emit a value, which in this case is an array of Pizza objects.
The subscribe() method provides three callback functions:
    The first callback function logs the emitted value.
    The second callback function logs any errors that occur.
    The third callback function is executed when the Observable completes.
